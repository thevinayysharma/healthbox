Technical Implementation:


*Dynamic 3D visualization of Medical Report and Data
- constructing 3D body parts 
 [ 3D MODELS PRECISE - ART BASED, create simulations - mathematically ]

- filling body with mathematical connections
- connect data and bodily parts (color wise)
- add text labels, visual labels and small video per effect.

*Predictive Health Modelling
- slider based ( increase decrease in bodily impact)


*Medicin Impact Simulation Understanding
( how medicain affects - visual dynamic flow)
